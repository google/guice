/**
 * A Provider that is part of an extension which supports a custom BindingTargetVisitor.
 *
 * <p>When an extension binds a provider instance, the provider can implement this interface to
 * allow users using the {@link Binding#acceptTargetVisitor(BindingTargetVisitor)} method to visit a
 * custom visitor designed for that extension. A typical implementation within the extension would
 * look like
 *
 * <pre>
 * &lt;V, B> V acceptExtensionVisitor(BindingTargetVisitor&lt;B, V> visitor, ProviderInstanceBinding&lt;? extends B> binding) {
 *   if(visitor instanceof MyCustomExtensionVisitor) {
 *     return ((MyCustomExtensionVisitor&lt;B, V>)visitor).visitCustomExtension(customProperties, binding);
 *   } else {
 *     return visitor.visit(binding);
 *   }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * 'MyCustomExtensionVisitor' in the example above would be an interface the extension provides that
 * users can implement in order to be notified of custom extension information. These visitor
 * interfaces must extend from BindingTargetVisitor.
